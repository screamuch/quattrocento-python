# quattrocento-python

This repository contains Python code that can be used to interface with OT Bioelettronica Quattrocento HD EMG biological signal amplifier. The code is based on [Sessantoquattro control repository](https://github.com/SPosella/Python-codes) provided by the manufacturer, and modified to work with Quattrocento.

It is designed to be relatively easily modified and embedded in any project that involves processing real time HD EMG data.

## Installation

This code has been developed for a Python 3.8 environment.

Download and install it on your system:

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/screamuch/quattrocento-python
  $ cd quattrocento-python
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The bulk of configuration happens in the `configuration_generator.py` file, except the network parameters. Those are set in `stream_data.py`:

```python
# Network settings
ip_address = '192.168.0.103'    # written on the QC's LCD
port = 23456                    # can be changed in online interface
```

Then, follow directions in `configuration_generator.py` and [communication protocol](https://otbioelettronica.it/en/?preview=1&option=com_dropfiles&format=&task=frontfile.download&catid=41&id=70&Itemid=1000000000000) to set your acquisition parameters.

### Default configuration

As is, this code will print an array of integers that represent signal from each electrode. By default, it is set up to work with the following configuration:

- `MULTIPLE IN1`
    - `AD1x64` 64 channels single adapter
    - `GR10MM0808` 64 Adhesive Array 10mm i.e.d. sensor
    - `Extensor Digitorum Communis` muscle (forearm)
    - `Right` side
    - `Monopolar` acquisition mode
    - `10Hz` High Pass Filter
    - `500Hz` Low Pass Filter


## Usage

### Demo

To run this code with default parameters, read the **Configuration** section to set the IP address and port of your Quattrocento device.

Then simply run:

```bash
$ python stream_data.py
```

Or, if you want to write the data directly into a CSV file, run:

```bash
$ python write_to_csv.py example
```

And you will see `example.csv` file with captured data.

### Custom Usage

To run this code outside the demo, place `stream_data.py` and `configuration_generator.py` in your project folder. Add the following lines to your code, and use the `emg_data_frame` variable as you need.

```python
import stream_data

# Network settings
ip_address = '192.168.0.103'    # written on the QC's LCD
port = 23456                    # can be changed in online interface

# Create start command and get basic setup information
(start_command,
number_of_channels,
sample_frequency,
bytes_in_sample) = stream_data.create_bin_command(start=1)

connection = stream_data.connect_to_qc(ip_address, port, start_command)

# Replace with a desired condition
while True:
    emg_data_frame = stream_data.read_emg_signal(connection,
                            number_of_channels,
                            bytes_in_sample,
                            output_milli_volts=False)

    # Adjust the following line to your needs
    print(emg_data_frame)

# Sends a stop acquisition command to quattrocento
# Not necessary, but saves battery on the amplifier
stream_data.disconnect_from_qc(connection)
```

Additionally, you can refer to `write_to_csv.py` file for an example of how it can be done.

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
